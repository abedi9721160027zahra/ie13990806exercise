<h2 id="box2"><li> HTML </li></h2>
<p class="resize"><strong>Markup Language (HTML)</strong>  is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br />
  It can be assisted by technologies such as<em> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</em> and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br />
  Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br />
  <i>HTML</i> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

<h2 id="box2"><li>CSS</li></h2>
<p class="resize">
  <u>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</u> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
  <br />CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
  <br />CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
  <br />This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .
  <br />css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .
  <br />css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
