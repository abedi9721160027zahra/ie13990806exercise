<h1>About Internet Engeenering</h1>
<p>Internet engineering blends electrical and computer engineering with computer science and information systems.
  <br /> 
  As an Internet engineer, you would design, develop, and implement network and communication systems, Internet systems, and software applications.
  <br />
  You also would troubleshoot and solve problems with networks and telecommunications systems.</p>

<h2><li> HTML </li></h2>
<p><strong>Markup Language (HTML)</strong>  is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br />
  It can be assisted by technologies such as<em> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</em> and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br />
  Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br />
  <i>HTML</i> describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
</p>

<h2><li>CSS</li></h2>
<p>
  <u>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</u> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
  <br />CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
  <br />CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
  <br />This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .
  <br />css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .
  <br />css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

<h2><li>Computer Network</li></h2>
<p>
  A <b>computer network</b> is a group of computers that use a set of common communication protocols over digital interconnections for the purpose of sharing resources located on or provided by the network nodes.
  <br />The interconnections between nodes are formed from a broad spectrum of telecommunication network technologies, based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies.
  <br />The recommendation X.200 describes seven layers, labelled 1 to 7. Layer 1 is the lowest layer in this model.
